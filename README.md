# Hi, I'm Daisy 🌸

I'm a third-year B.Tech student working on building intelligent, accessible machine learning systems — especially in vision-language and medical AI domains.

🧠 My work blends:
- **Deep Learning** – Vision Transformers, NLP, and model deployment
- **UX-Driven AI Tools** – Real-time captioning apps, GUI design, voice-driven ML workflows
- **Human-Centered Design** – Accessibility, modularity, and ML tooling for non-experts

🔬 Current Projects:
- 🩺 **Medical Diagnosis Framework** – An interactive ML assistant for image-based disease classification
- 🖼️ **Image Caption Generator** – Offline ViT-GPT2 app with ONNX optimization and GUI
- 📱 **Design Patent** – Device-assisted ML guidance system (under review)

💡 I like building things that make complex ideas usable. Especially when they involve **transformers**, **touch interfaces**, and **just enough chaos** to be interesting.
